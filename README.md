# Due Dates
# November 12th 

– Due: students must upload to Blackboard a compiled Rmarkdown document (and
code and dataset that generates it) that includes example summary statistics from the dataset to be
studied. This should include a summary table of means, max, mins and standard deviations; data
transformations performed for feature engineering, as well as at least five plots revealing interesting
patterns to be studied. These must be motivated by the analysis – they cannot just be random plots.

# November 19th 

– Due: students must upload to Blackboard a compiled Rmarkdown document that
shows one model(s) estimated against the data. Code and replication files are required.

# Nov 21, Dec 3rd, Dec 5th: 

- Due: a 10-15 minute presentation in class describing and motivating the
question to be studied, summary statistics over the data, the baseline analysis, some robustness checks,
as well as a conclusion. Students must send the professor your slides beforehand. I will send a sign-up
sheet for your presentation slot later in the semester.

# Friday of finals week @ 5pm: 

- Final project code, replication files, dataset, and 4-8 page writeup
describing your problem, motivating the problem, summary statistics, analysis, as well as results and
conclusion. 

# Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

# Content
This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.

# Acknowledgements
This public dataset is part of Airbnb, and the original source can be found on this website(http://insideairbnb.com/).

# Inspiration
What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
Which hosts are the busiest and why?
Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
